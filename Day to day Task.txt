We also tested latest code base in Naveena's machine, 
 found that the email-attachment is working but fails in certain scenarios. 

1 is during re-publish meeting
another one is when protocol does not have any chairs. 

I have fixed the issues, it would be part of next build.

Regarding Document download issue in VAL. I found that the recent code change is not working in IE11.
I think the modification we made for data access implementation is causing this issue.  
If we revert the change it works for ie,chrome as well as firefox.

No Idea, how it went through in VAL. 
May be, it was uploaded before build and downloaded after build.

23/06

Yesterday after the call I had connected with Jaya on some technical discussions for the CR.
To send email notification to safety desk for open report in SAET.
Based on discussion i am working on the logic to fetch safety desk email addresses.

26/06
For email notification to safety desk. I am prepping the db information.
I have written a initial query to fetch CRO safety specialist for a case number, 
but it is not working for network protocol. I need to check with Jaya. Will connect if he is free after the call.

27/07
Yesterday after the call I connected with Jaya and we had a discussion about email notification to safety desk.
As per the discussion I started development activities.

28/08
I am working on email notification to safety desk in SAE tracker.

03/07

I created the stored procedure to send notification to safety desk in sae tracker
. I have couple of questions.
Do we need to run this job everyday?
As Jaya mentioned earlier, do we need to have some mechanism such as
send notification only if cases are kept open for certain time period? this may decide based on report status date.
Currently I considered only individaul occurance cases. Do we need to consider aggregate report as well?

05/07

I am done with the development of batch email to safety desk.
Code cleanup and check-in is pending
123232

07/06

I am done with the development of batch email to safety desk. I am doing the unit testing.
I deployed the code into integration. I can give a demo and tune up if there is any change.

07/07

I have gone through the recent update made to notification PBI by Deepali.
The challenge here is to me is that generate & attaching a file. 
I have not seen in the source code where we attach the file while sending email from mail queue
, I dont think existing framework supports.
I need to discuss with Jaya.

10/07

I replied to Kristin's email with my thoughts for sending email notifications on 
every 15 days once. Jaya & Murali let me know your thoughts as well.

First approach could be, We can have a data model to capture last email sent date for every cases.
Based on the last email sent date we can calculate the next reminder day.

Nex approch could be without data model.
We can do exact match while picking up the cases like 15 days opened, 30 days opened., 45 days so on.
The drawback here is, Any cases falls between these days 16 to 29 opted out. but it will be included in the next cycle.
By the time of 15 days it will be stabilized, later all cases will fall in any one these bucket.

11/07
I have applied the new template in email to safety desk.  
Added the new column #Days of pending closure.  Deployed into integration.

12/07
I created the DML script and did code clean up for safety desk email and kept it ready for check-in.
Later configured the PM application to analyze report which Deepali mentioned.

I have a question, how these grant/contract records populated? Is it through some service/manual entry?
If I take some award number and i am not seeing proper party pair association in the table
thats y program officer not showing in "Award Numbers by Study Phase" report.

13/07

I updated the safety desk email based on the mock up sent by Kristin and deployed into integration.
I am working on the DSMB real time email issue which I discussed with Murali.

14/07

I fixed the DSMB real time email issues and deployed into integration.
Apart from the I posted in question to kristin & Jaya in teams regarding case count in safety desk email.
If we have 2 records with same case number and different disposition number.
Do we need to consider the case count as 1 or 2?
I need to make a slight adjustment in logic because currently it is counting every record.

17/07

I created the DML script and checked-in the safety desk email source code as well as 
DSMB real time email bug fix. Murali, to reproduce page unresponsive error in agenda tab, 
how many document needs to be uploaded. 


18/07

I removed to some redundant function call in document upload and tested the impact.
Also verified the page unresponsive error after the fix. Looking at other bugs assigned to me.

Today morning I connected with Jaya to discuss about pending work in Stop date CR.
As per the discussion I did the change in the report to include stop date. 

Kristin, do we need to include stop date in disposition form.

Today morning more than 3 hours I could not connect to my machine through RDC. I sent email to service desk
Is that sufficient or we need to speak to some one?

20/07

I completed the SAET Report to include Stop date, deployed to INT and codes are checked-in
Updated the safety desk email template to remove grey text and mail link subject.

Spent some time to investigate the reason for Diane Brown not appearing in safety desk email as per Lekha's post.
The reason is, we are not considering the person who is not having email ID.

AND, I have not faced any connection issue today.

I would like to know where we need to include outcome of event in the report.

24/07

14/08

there is some increasing interest in the Protocol Management functionality that provides the ability to export an XML file that can be imported into ClinicalTrials.gov. If any of you find yourself with downtime/lighter workload, I would appreciate help with:

reviewing the SDD to ensure all of the details are up to date
reviewing the export and making sure it uploads properly into the test clinicaltrials.gov system
gap analysis of any fields required by clinicaltrials.gov that are not actually in the XML (hopefully this should not be the case, but should confirm)

121519 - COI Report Bug

16/08
For missing reviewer warning box chopping the content, I need to connect with Lekha to understand more.

Currently i have considered the latest award number based on application perion end date.
when protocol associated with multiple award numbers.

18/10

I have written the logic to get award numbers based on activity code and serial number as mentioned by Jaya.
But this logic does not work when serial number/activity code is null or empty.
There are few records are not having serial number, activity code 
and application period end date in integration DB
So we need to figure what we need to do in these cases.

19/10
Yesterday after the call, I connected with Jaya to discuss the approach on fetchig award numbers.
Based on that I made the changes and deployed to intergration. The DB related changes are checked-in
I need to check-in the application since maintenance branch created few minutes back by Swathi.

I made the changes by introducing temporary table
instead of inline queries but it takes more time than before. I need to check with Pankaj.

Anitha said there was some issues in my last db check-in. I made changes and checked-in. she confirmed that it is working fine now.
Then, I worked on PM report to include executive secretary and also started script for support staff.
I need one clarification Deepali & Murali, To display executive secretary for protocol, that person 
should be part study team members with the role ES.

05/06

I analyzed the code and tested in integration environment, i did not find any issues. Lekha, please check once in integration.

20/06

I made a mistake while updating person roles for support staff so I gave a script to Anita for data correction in STD and VAL database.
I updated all the person roles records of Deepali & Kristin  with support staff role without proper where clause.
It will not be an issue if there is a DB refresh.

Currently, i am working on SDD document for Executive secretary and Support staff.

I think as Jaya Suggested we need to rename "Support Staff" and "Executive Secretary",  to match with the naming convention used by other roles
"DAIT DSMB Support Staff (DAIT DSMB)"
"DAIT DSMB Executive Secretary (DAIT DSMB)"

26/06

I renamed the executive secretary and support staff. Checked-in the script.
Currently I am working on SDD document for executive secretary and support staff.
Lekha mentioned couple of bugs but i need a walkthrough to understand.

26/06

I am working on bug fixing as per the list mentioned by Lekha.
The 4th item, Martha Nason not inviting by default is due to division scope, we need to test after editing in master contact.
Lekha, I am not clear on issue no 9,10 and 11, need your help to understand.


27/06
I fixed the bug number 9,10 and 11 from the Lekha's list, i checked-in the code.
Bug number 4 where martha nason not adding as default invitee is due to configuration issue.
The associated organization was not in DAIT scope. I can show how i configured in master contact as lekha requested.

Murali, Can we connect after the scrum on Guidance document issue. looks like some bootstrap issue,
need some help on this.

01/07

I believe all the bugs are fixed except add recipient bug.
Lekha, correct me if i am wrong.
Murali said that he will fix, i think he dint get time. I am working on add recipient bug. 

02/07

I fixed the add recipient issue in guidance document and deployed into INT and not checked-in. 
It is the vue3 upgrade issue.
Lekha, please check once in intigration. 
Support role bugs are fixed and it will be part of today's build.

03/07

As Kristin mentioned in the group chat, I verified the Protocol At Sites report. In the first glance I noticed
Study Chair is incorrect, Disease/condition is blank in the attached excel file. To fix and analyze further, 
i am not able to connect to TFS to set up application.

Looks like server is down. 
In the conflict type CR, I fixed one bug and deployed to integration and analyzed bug number 4, but could not reproduce.
connecting with Lekha, just before. we did not see the issue.

Jaya, r u facing the TFS issue?


04/07
Agenda Finalized issue has been fixed and available in Integration. removing COI requirement working fine.(for new meeting)
Lekha posted 4 bugs for ES. 1st one I am still working on. No.5 is fixed and it will be available in next build in STD and VAL.
No. 8. Also fixed and codes are checked-in
No. 10 ES have ability to distribute short form. It is fixed, but you have to check for new meeting.
I also prepared the script for correcting duplicate person role records.
Guidance document add recipient issue is fixed and is available in integration. 
In conflict type CR, COI report related issue fixed and checked-in. 
The default tab selection in COI dashboard issue has been fixed and deployed to INT


09/07
I am not able to reproduce the bug which Lekha mentioned as critical in COI dashboard. (I created the new meeting to test this in integration)
Lekha mentioned 4 bugs are pending in executive secretary. I thought 3 bugs r fixed in integration, Rekha says 2 are still open, need to check again.
may be due to refresh. if so it will be fixed in today's build.
The bug where agenda comments are not displaying properly with lengthy number. It is due to bootstrap upgrade, I did not find the proper fix.
It may not be critical since user may not enter such a lengthy number in reality. In the apply previous review decision CR, I tried to re-produce 2 bugs,
include critical bugs.
but I could not, need to connect with Lekha to understand further.

10/07

As I discussed with Lekha yesterday, there is one bug where Executive secretary sees COI links in pending task dashboard. I fixed today and available in 
integration. I gone through the conflict type CR, bug number 18 where validation fires where we click on "not specified" and Yes button. 
It looks OK has it is a behavior of validation framework which we can see in other place as well.
Bug number 4 - Where show details button show conflict description in the back ground for DP. I am not able reproduce.
Bug number 11 and 12 the is a clarification, let us wait for Murali. Bug no 14, When we revise the existing meeting whether we need to add template 1.0 or
2.0? what should be the expected behavior. This is for new invitee.
Bug no. 16. The conflict description is not hidden by default. Whether this bug is still there?
Bug no. 17 was already fixed. - UI space.
I can connect to Lekha to discuss in detail. 

11/07
Yesterday after scrum call, I connected with Lekha and discussed the fix and closed couple of bugs, another bug may not be a bug.
I fixed the bug# 14 in conflict CR Where legacy meeting created with old template should carry the old template even if we new invitee
after publishing. It should carry the same template entire cycle.
Fix is available in integration please check.

Lekha, the extra space in COI form, we need to correct the new template. I did not find the DML script to checked-in to correct the conflict template.
I dont know how it is inserted to new conflict template table. Jaya do you have any idea?
I need to start working on PM report. Lekha let us connect on the open bug


15/07

I fixed the bug in Protocol At Sites report of PM and deployed to integration.
I noticed that there is an issue in Pending Tasks where Executive secretary able to see COI Pending submission link.
Corrected and deployed to integration.
As Deepali mentioned, the language in COI form has been corrected and available in integration. Code r checked-in.
I have not re-deployed support role stored procedure to integration. I will do it.

16/07

As we discussed yesterday I have reverted the fix related to Executive Secretary Pending Tasks.
Lekha, As per Jaya and Murali, if we enable the COI for Executive secretary we should display the link pending task to fill the form.

I corrected the bug in 

18/09

I am modifying the stored procedure to add default invitee based on the domain configuration.
It is in progress.


19/09

I completed the coding for default invitee, To do unit testing, the agenda finalized step is timing out even before applying my changes. Looks like some db issue, I contacted Anitha, disk space is full it seems and she is
looking into it. If everything works i can give a demo on Monday.

24/09

I completed default invitee CR and deployed to integration. Since it is not signed and planned for march release.
I will handover the source code, DML script and documentation tomorrow. Let me know if you need a demo.


25/09

I shared the source code, DML Script, stored procedure and documents belongs to default invitee CR
